# Environment

Host facts, tools, credentials, and command cheat-sheet for this project.
Update whenever a new tool, credential, or host-specific quirk is learned.

## Host

- **Dev**: Linux (kernel 6.8) / bash / user `keeper` / repo at `/home/keeper/repo/positive-news-evaluator`
- **Prod**: same host. Code at `/opt/news-evaluator/evaluator.py`, config at `/etc/news-evaluator/news-evaluator.env` (`/home/keeper` is 750, other users cannot read the repo). Permanent mode: systemd `news-evaluator.timer` runs a batch every 10 min under the dedicated `newsevaluator` user (`newscrawler` group). Everything is installed by `sudo bash deploy/install.sh`, which the **owner must run** — agents may not create system users (see `AGENTS/MEMORY.md`). Until then manual batches run under `newscrawler`.

## Tools

- git; commit identity `wildcar <wildcar@mail.ru>`; GitHub push via `gh` auth (account `wildcar`).
- Sibling repo: `~/repo/positive-news-crawler` — the upstream crawler; its `docs/database-contract.md` defines the `exchange_*` SQLite contract this service consumes.
- model-router-mcp: MCP server for model access, systemd unit `model-router-mcp.service`, Streamable HTTP endpoint `http://127.0.0.1:8088/mcp`, deployed at `/opt/model-router-mcp`, sources at `~/repo/model-router-mcp`. Registered deepseek chat models: `deepseek-chat`, `deepseek-reasoner`.

## Credentials & secrets

- Router Bearer token: `AUTH_TOKEN` in `/opt/model-router-mcp/.env` (root-readable via sudo). Pass to the evaluator as `ROUTER_AUTH_TOKEN`; never commit it.
- Local env files (`.env*`) are gitignored and must not be committed.

## Environments

| Env | Host | Identifier | Role / account | Where used |
|-----|------|------------|----------------|------------|
| dev  | local Linux | `/home/keeper/repo/positive-news-evaluator` | `keeper` | development, unit tests |
| prod | same host | `/var/lib/newscrawler/newscrawler.sqlite3`, `/opt/news-evaluator` | `newscrawler` (test runs); dedicated user pending | read queue, write events + scores |

## Commands cheat-sheet

### Dev

```
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests          # unit tests, no network
```

### Prod

```
# install / update everything (owner runs this: creates the newsevaluator user,
# copies code + units, auto-fills the router token, enables the timer)
sudo bash deploy/install.sh

# status & logs
systemctl list-timers news-evaluator.timer
sudo journalctl -u news-evaluator.service -n 50
sudo systemctl start news-evaluator.service    # run one batch right now

# model / batch tuning: edit /etc/news-evaluator/news-evaluator.env
# (EVALUATOR_MODEL empty -> router picks by provider/tier), applies next run

# manual batch under newscrawler (fallback while the dedicated user is absent)
TOKEN=$(sudo grep '^AUTH_TOKEN=' /opt/model-router-mcp/.env | cut -d= -f2-)
sudo -u newscrawler env ROUTER_AUTH_TOKEN="$TOKEN" \
  bash -c 'umask 0007; python3 /opt/news-evaluator/evaluator.py --limit 3'
# add --dry-run to print scores without writing
```

## Host-specific quirks

### Dev

- `127.0.0.1:8000` is the crawler web UI (waitress, redirects to https) — the model router is on `8088`.

### Prod

- SQLite sidecar files (`-wal`, `-shm`) must stay group-accessible: clients run with `umask 0007` (see the crawler's `docs/database-contract.md`).
- FastMCP redirects `/mcp` to `/mcp/` with 307; urllib does not re-POST on redirects — the evaluator's client follows 307/308 manually.
- The router's deepseek adapter forwards only `temperature`, `max_tokens`, `top_p` from params; `response_format` (JSON mode) does not reach the provider, so strict JSON relies on the prompt plus validation.
